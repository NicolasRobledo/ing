In Neuracache style, to make a flashcard you do #flashcard
The next lines then become the back of the flashcard

If you want, it's certainly possible to
do a multi-line question #flashcard
You just need to make sure both
the question and answer are one paragraph.

And, of course #flashcard


Whitespace is ignored!
